# ScanToShopApp

NOTE: Checkout the Wiki to see image previews of the latest version of the App!


The Scan to Shop (STS) application, a software system that brings checkout functionality to smartphones for users to grab and purchase their goods at grocery stores, in real time. The STS application uses smartphone cameras to scan item barcodes and obtain item data from a cloud database. These scanned items as well as their information is displayed to the user and can be added to their shopping trolley on the application. At the end of their shopping session, users are able to checkout their shopping trolley via online payment. 

All receipts for transactions made through the application are generated and stored on a cloud database. Each user is made a database account, where their transactional documents, information and data are kept separate and organised. Users are able to access their records through the application, receiving a completion collection of all their transaction receipts.

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Run the App

- To install flutter, please follow the link (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Regardless of platform downloading flutter on, follow instructions to download Android Studio.

Step 2:
- Open up the project using Android Studio.

Step 3:
- Follow the link to learn how to run the app on an android emulator (https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)
- For best results, use a Nexus 6 API 30 as an emulator, but are welcome to use any other android device as as emulator
- It is reccommended that you connect an android phone to compile the app on as it will provide the ability to scan the barcodes in real time! running a     simulator will not let you scan a barcode!
